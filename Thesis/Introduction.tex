\section{Introduction}

We will investigate if it is possible to use the newly proposed \texttt{R}-package \inlabru to make fast Bayesian inference on Lee-Carter types of models. We will specifically consider some versions of the Lee-Carter model applied to lung and stomach cancer data, but we note that our findings could be generalized to other models with a Lee-Carter type of structure, as well as general mortality in addition to cause-specific mortality.
