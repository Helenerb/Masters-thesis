\section{Closing Remarks}
%We have seen that \inlabru is a good tool for Bayesian inference, providing fast and accurate results for cases where classic Monte Carlo methods converges slowly or not at all. 

%Or: There are clear indicaions that \inlabru is a good method for Bayesian inference, even though it displays some vague differences compared to results displayed by Monte Carlo methods that we are unable to explain.
