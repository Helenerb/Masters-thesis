 abstract = {Time series methods are used to make long-run forecasts, with confidence intervals, of age-specific mortality in the United States from 1990 to 2065. First, the logs of the age-specific death rates are modeled as a linear function of an unobserved period-specific intensity index, with parameters depending on age. This model is fit to the matrix of U.S. death rates, 1933 to 1987, using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method; it accounts for almost all the variance over time in age-specific death rates as a group. Whereas e0 has risen at a decreasing rate over the century and has decreasing variability, k(t) declines at a roughly constant rate and has roughly constant variability, facilitating forecasting. k(t), which indexes the intensity of mortality, is next modeled as a time series (specifically, a random walk with drift) and forecast. The method performs very well on within-sample forecasts, and the forecasts are insensitive to reductions in the length of the base period from 90 to 30 years; some instability appears for base periods of 10 or 20 years, however. Forecasts of age-specific rates are derived from the forecasts of k, and other life table variables are derived and presented. These imply an increase of 10.5 years in life expectancy to 86.05 in 2065 (sexes combined), with a confidence band of plus 3.9 or minus 5.6 years, including uncertainty concerning the estimated trend. Whereas 46\% now survive to age 80, by 2065 46\% will survive to age 90. Of the gains forecast for person-years lived over the life cycle from now until 2065, 74\% will occur at age 65 and over. These life expectancy forecasts are substantially lower than direct time series forecasts of e0, and have far narrower confidence bands; however, they are substantially higher than the forecasts of the Social Security Administration's Office of the Actuary.},

abstract = {The predominant way of modelling mortality rates is the Lee–Carter model and its many extensions. The Lee–Carter model and its many extensions use a latent process to forecast. These models are estimated using a two-step procedure that causes an inconsistent view on the latent variable. This paper considers identifiability issues of these models from a perspective that acknowledges the latent variable as a stochastic process from the beginning. We call this perspective the plug-in age–period or plug-in age–period–cohort model. Defining a parameter vector that includes the underlying parameters of this process rather than its realizations, we investigate whether the expected values and covariances of the plug-in Lee–Carter models are identifiable. It will be seen, for example, that even if in both steps of the estimation procedure we have identifiability in a certain sense it does not necessarily carry over to the plug-in models.}

abstract = {Interest in cohort effects in mortality data has increased dramatically in recent years, with much of the research focused on extensions of the Lee–Carter model incorporating cohort parameters. However, some studies find that these models are not robust to changes in the data or fitting algorithm, which limits their suitability for many purposes. It has been suggested that these robustness problems may be the result of an unresolved identifiability issue. In this paper, after investigating systemically the robustness of cohort extensions of the Lee–Carter model and the convergence of the algorithms used to fit it to data, we demonstrate the existence of such an identifiability issue and propose an additional approximate identifiability constraint which solves many of the problems found.}

abstract = {The ability to produce accurate mortality forecasts, accompanied by a set of representative uncertainty bands, is crucial in the planning of public retirement funds and various life-related businesses. In this paper, we focus on one of the drawbacks of the Poisson Lee–Carter model (Brouhns et al., 2002) that imposes mean–variance equality, restricting mortality variations across individuals. Specifically, we present two models to potentially account for overdispersion. We propose to fit these models within the Bayesian framework for various advantages, but primarily for coherency. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are implemented to carry out parameter estimation. Several comparisons are made with the Bayesian Poisson Lee–Carter model (Czado et al., 2005) to highlight the importance of accounting for overdispersion. We demonstrate that the methodology we developed prevents over-fitting and yields better calibrated prediction intervals for the purpose of mortality projections. Bridge sampling is used to approximate the marginal likelihood of each candidate model to compare the models quantitatively.}

Specifically, the original method is embedded in a Poisson regression model, which is perfectly suited for age–sex-specific mortality rates. This model is fitted for each sex to a set of age-specific Belgian death rates. A time-varying index of mortality is forecasted in an ARIMA framework. These forecasts are used to generate projected age-specific mortality rates, life expectancies and life annuities net single premiums. Finally, a Brass-type relational model is proposed to adapt the projections to the annuitants population, allowing for estimating the cost of adverse selection in the Belgian whole life annuity market.}
