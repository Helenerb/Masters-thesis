\section{Results}
First, we use synthetic data to show that $\texttt{inlabru}$ produces restults that are sufficiently similar to the one produced by more traditional MCMC approaches. For a fair comparison between the $\texttt{INLA}$ framework and state-of-the-art MCMC methods, we compare results of Bayesian inference using $\texttt{inlabru}$ to results using inference from the STAN methodology. The STAN methodology is an implementation of a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo approach, and is described more closely in Section \ref{sec:stan}. We use the $\texttt{R}$-library $\texttt{rstan}$ to do inference with STAN. 

\subsection{STAN: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo}
\label{sec:stan}
STAN is a method for Bayesian inference using a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo approach. It was proposed by ... and has since its introduction gained popularity for its computational power compared to traditional MCMC approaches. bla bla ikke ferdig!!!
