\section{Comparison of Results from STAN and Inlabru}
\label{sec:StanInlabru}

To investigate if inference with \inlabru gives the same 

We begin by checking that \inlabru and \stan produce the same results for 

\subsection{Produce Synthetic Data}
In order to check that the inference results from \inlabru are correct, also for the underlying random effects $\alpha_x$, $\beta_x$, $\kappa_t$ are correct
